# 🤖 Leonel Ivan Cardoso

<p> My name is Leonel, I am from Argentina, I am currently learning JavaScript (I will upload the complete project soon), and I love writing code, it stresses me sometimes but it is very nice and gratifying to see the final result working! In my spare time, I love to watch science videos, movies, or spend time with my 🐶. I'm a bit of a Nerd / Geek with everything that has to do with technology and science (Including the arduino what I bought at 13 years old) 😁 </p>

Projects
They are the ones to whom I spent the most time and with whom I learned the most, that is why I feel that they were important to me.
